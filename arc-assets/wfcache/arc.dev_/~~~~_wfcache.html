We respect your commitment and the challenges you face   particularly the growing demand to improve outcomes along with the constant drumbeat of do more with less. Turnover and its associated high costs can seem out of control. And EBP EBTs don t always deliver anticipated improvements in client outcomes, despite significant investments in dollars and staff time to implement them. Fact-based strategic direction We have studied and worked in numerous child welfare and mental health agencies nationwide, and our research shows that organizations doing similar work often get very different outcomes. Why? The difference is the organizations    cultures and climates. Agencies with better cultures and climates adapt better to new innovations like EBP EBTs. They have lower turnover. Their staffs have higher morale, job satisfaction and commitment. They have higher service quality. They get better client outcomes. The first step The first step is an objective assessment of your organization   s culture and climate, and we have the best tool in the U.S. for that. Our OSC Measure is the only one that is nationally-normed for child welfare and mental health organizations. With it you will be able to see how your organization scores compared to others like it across the nation. With your scores in hand   whether positive, negative or in between   you will, for the first time, have objective data to guide your strategic thinking about your organization   s culture and climate.

ARC implementation  Over the past 15 years we have developed a research-proven organizational change strategy for organizations like yours called ARC. ARC is without peer in child welfare and mental health services. ARC has been shown to reduce turnover, improve client outcomes, and more, across three rigorous multi-year research trials called RCTs (randomized controlled trials). No other change strategy available to you has been tested in even a single RCT We will work with you to tailor a change strategy specifically designed for your organization based on your OSC Measure scores, the opportunities and challenges that you and your executive team want to address, and our research-proven techniques.

The literature is clear    organizational culture and climate affect organizations    staffs, impact clients    outcomes, and alter the findings of research projects (Denison & Mishra, 1995  Glisson, 2007  Glisson & Hemmelgarn, 1998  Hoy, 1990  Joyce & Slocum, 1984  Petty et al., 1995  Schneider et al., 1994, Wilkins & Ouchi, 1983  Glisson et al. 2010  Glisson & Williams, 2015). What is organizational social context? Organizational social context encompasses the human dimension of an organization including employees  expectations, how the organization  feels , and how employees interact with each other and with their clients. Its two most salient elements are the organization   s culture and climate. A growing body of research suggests that culture and climate have a large impact on the delivery of human services, affecting services, implementation, quality and outcomes. What is organizational culture and climate? Organizational culture is an organization-level construct defined as the behavioral expectations that members of an organization are required to meet in their work environment (Verbeke et al., 1998). These expectations prescribe work behavior and socialize new employees in the priorities that are most important to the organization. Organizational culture is often described as including values (Rousseau, 1990) and several studies indicate that culture is developed and maintained in a workforce through behavioral expectations that reflect values (Ashkanasy, Broadfoot, & Falcus, 2000  Hofstede, 1998  Hofstede, Neuijen, Ohayv, & Sanders, 1990). Psychological climate (as distinct from organizational climate) is assessed as individual employees    perceptions of the psychological impact of their work environment on their own functioning and well-being. For example, an individual may experience his or her work climate as highly stressful (James & James, 1989). When employee   s perceptions are similar they can be aggregated to describe the organizational climate of their work environment. For example, an organization   s work environment would be characterized as stressful if the employees shared the experience of high levels of stress (Jones & James, 1979  Joyce & Slocum, 1984). The OSC Measure  arc-block-quote align= pull-right  Our professional staff will help you determine if the OSC Measure is a good choice for your study. We re eager to answer any questions that you may have. To contact us, click here.  arc-block-quote  The OSC Measure is a 105-item questionnaire (taking 20 minutes) that assesses organizational culture, climate and work attitudes (job satisfaction and organizational commitment).   Only frontline staff complete the OSC because supervisors and leaders often have an imprecise understanding line level expectations and perceptions. Researchers conducting clinical trials, implementation studies and other research in a wide variety of settings and across a range of populations are using our OSC Measure to assess, and track over time, the cultures and climates of the organizations in which they are conducting their studies. The OSC Measure is particularly powerful in child welfare and mental health studies because it has been nationally normed for these settings. It has also been used effectively in a growing list of other settings, including substance abuse and 12-step programs, homeless shelters, child and adult autism services, nursing homes, hospitals and hospital emergency rooms, and crisis stabilization units. The Dimensions of Organizational culture The OSC Measure assesses organizational culture on three primary dimensions  rigidity, proficiency and resistance. Rigid cultures expect that service providers will have no flexibility in carrying out their jobs, provide limited input into key management decisions, and carefully follow a host of bureaucratic rules and regulations (alpha reliability in current sample = .81). Proficient organizational cultures expect that service providers will place the well-being of each client first, be competent and have up-to-date knowledge (alpha reliability = .94). Resistant cultures expect that service providers will show little interest in new ways of providing services and suppress any change effort (alpha reliability = .81). The Dimensions of Organizational climate The OSC Measure assesses organizational climate on three primary dimensions  engagement, functionality and stress. Service providers in engaged climates perceive that they are able to personally accomplish many worthwhile things and remain personally involved in their work and concerned about their clients (alpha reliability in current sample = .78). Service providers in functional climates perceive they have the cooperation and help they need from coworkers and administrators to do a good job and have a clear understanding of how they can work successfully within the organization (alpha reliability = .90). Service providers in stressful climates perceive they are emotionally exhausted from their work, overloaded in their work, and conflicted in their job responsibilities (alpha reliability = .94) . The Dimensions of Work attitudes The OSC Measure also measures individual-level work attitudes with two scales measuring the individual   s job satisfaction and commitment to the organization (Glisson & Durick, 1988). Employees with high job satisfaction appraise their everyday job tasks positively (alpha reliability = .84) and employees with high organizational commitment are invested in their organization   s success and intend to remain as employees of their organization (alpha reliability = .92). National norms The OSC Measure has been nationally normed for use in two settings  child welfare (n=1740 staff in 81 agencies) and mental health (n=1154 staff in 100 agencies) (Glisson et al., 2012  Glisson et al. 2008). This means that the OSC Measure offers a comparison of where any agency ranks nationally relative to its peer group. To our knowledge, it is the only culture and climate measure that has been normed for use in child welfare and mental health. Predicting outcomes Positive cultures and climates predict a number of positive outcomes for organization   s staff and clients.   These organizations have lower staff turnover, the ability to sustain new programs and technologies, and more positive attitudes toward the use of evidence based practices (EBPs).   Additionally, clients served by these organizations tend to have better outcomes, such as improved well-being and greater reductions in problem behaviors, and also report more positive attitudes about the quality of the treatments they receive.   In regard to youth outcomes, problematic behaviors as reported on the Shortform Assessment for Children (a 48 item behavioral checklist that is filled out by parents and tracked for several months) have been shown to decrease over time for youth being served in agencies with more positive cultures and climates as measured by the Organizational Social Context scale (OSC). We are eager to help We have used the OSC Measure extensively in our own studies and have worked with numerous other Investigators to successfully use the OSC Measure and ARC in their studies. With that experience and expertise, we are ready to  Talk with you about your research project and help you determine if the OSC Measure is right for you.

Studied in a series of multi-year controlled trials funded by NIMH and the W.T. Grant Foundation, the ARC organizational change strategy works by systematically assessing and improving the cultures and climates of community and state child welfare and mental health agencies. Study results show that these improvements then produce a range of highly desirable outcomes for such agencies including lower turnover, higher employee job satisfaction, better uptake of innovations like EBPs and EBTs, and   most important   better outcomes for the youth these organizations serve.","link":"http:\/\/arc.dev\/arc-change-strategy\/"},{"title":"Onsite Workshops","content":"Onsite Workshops QUICK FACTS FOR ALL WORKSHOPS We have conducted research in and worked with child welfare and mental health organizations for over 20 years. Our research shows that agencies providing similar services are all over the map on their performance metrics. Our research shows that the difference is their organizational cultures and climates. Organizations with positive cultures and climates outperform their peers  better youth outcomes, better quality of care, lower turnover, etc. We have shown our ability to improve organizations    cultures and climates and to improve their performance metrics in multiple research trials. No one else has done this. Not even close. These workshops offer you the opportunity to learn from our experience. WORKSHOPS How effective is your organization   s culture and climate? Note  Prior to this workshop participating executives select 2-3 programs within their organizations to complete our nationally-normed measure of culture and climate called the OSC Measure. The resulting program profiles are shared anonymously during the workshop and subsequently discussed individually with the participants. This 1-day workshop uses nationally-normed data from the participating organizations as the basis for discussing the substantial impact that organizational culture and climate have on a variety of outcomes across organizations, including staff, client, and organizational outcomes. Participants will explore their agencies    external and internal challenges, and how leadership   s approaches to cope with these challenges impact their organizational culture and climate. The strengths and weaknesses of organizational systems (e.g. feedback) will be discussed in the context of culture and climate to help leaders understand and identify specific targets for change in organizational systems. Creating Psychologically Safe environments needed for successful change management Change is always hard. It is even harder when it is not safe to engage in that change. Failures in Continuous Improvement Programs, staff development initiatives, and implementation of new practices (EBP   s) or technologies often fail in agencies where members are embedded in a culture and climate where problems, errors, and barriers cannot be openly discussed and addressed. Indeed, front-line staff often comes to hate processes such as Continuous Improvement or data feedback because core problems interfering with success cannot be addressed safely within one   s organization. This 1-day workshop explores executive, management and front-line team behaviors necessary to create psychological safety. Participants are challenged to explore their own practices and deeply-held beliefs that either enhance or inhibit psychological safety. And, the connection of these behaviors and beliefs to system functioning, such as one   s discipline system, will be explored. Participants will leave with tools to identify and target specific behaviors as well as potential changes in organizational system usage to enhance their effectiveness. This simple and yet intuitively powerful strategy greatly enhances the implementation of improvement efforts. Creating highly effective human service organizations through the five ARC Guiding Principles We have developed an organizational change strategy that works. We know because we have tested it in multiple organizations and across multiple clinical trials with success across the United States. This change strategy is called ARC. ARC is built around 5 key principles that we derived from decades of previous work, mostly from the business world, and adapted for use in child welfare and mental health. Because organizational culture is based on values, all organizations have written and often unwritten principles that drive them. We know that executives who learn and actively work to imbed ARC   s five principles as part of their organizations    values and everyday activities will be more effective, and so will their organizations. This 1-day workshop is designed to share these principles with executive leadership and to help them develop a thorough understanding of their importance, usefulness and power. Their application in leadership behaviors, organizational systems, and processes we employ in ARC will be explored to help leadership identify potential targets for enhancement within their agencies. Similarly, underlying beliefs that leadership maintain will be explored to assess limitations and strengths that may exist in practicing these principles, allowing leaders to consider personal change efforts as well. How to establish the groundwork necessary for successfully implementing EBPs and EBTs Everyone is waking up to the fact that evidence-based practices and treatments aren   t working as expected in many of our community and state agencies, despite having worked under controlled circumstances when developed. This has been, and is, costly and frustrating to thousands of agencies nationally. Our research shows the way. The reality is that evidence-based programs do not exist independently  they    live    within, and depend on, the organizations that adopt them. To be successful, the social context of each organization must be aligned with and supportive of its EBPs EBTs. Paying attention to organizations    cultures and climates is a necessary precursor to effectively implementing these valuable practices and treatments. This 1  -day workshop explores key concepts, strategies and processes that can be used to help ensure the effective implementation of EBPs EBTs. Participants will learn initial steps that are needed to solidify the rationale and purpose for EBP EBT implementation, key processes and elements that must be in place prior to implementation, and key constructs and processes that must be embedded during implementation. Participants will explore their own existing strengths as well as identify specific targets for improving their capacity to successfully implement new treatments and practices. Data that works for everyone Human services agencies collect a lot of data. Most in fact are inundated with external demands for data. These external demands create internal top-down demands for data and monitoring that are easily and frequently perceived as quite negative by front-line staff and at times, leadership. What is needed are data systems that work for everyone. This means data that all levels of the organization view positively and put to use to improve the organization   s client, organizational and funding outcomes. Nonetheless, organizations    social contexts in which data systems are embedded are central to this process. In this 1-day workshop participants learn key concepts and practices necessary for effective data collection and usage, with particular emphasis on front-line staff, on whom achieving the agency   s mission ultimately rests. Work needed to build a context around data use that ensures success is described, as our key concepts that must guide data usage. Additionally, materials to help guide data system enhancements will be provided. Simple, yet powerful team and meeting tools that increase effectiveness. We have found repeatedly in our organizational improvement efforts across the nation that front-line team members, team leaders, upper mangers, and leaders benefit substantially from skill enhancement and tools for running effective meetings, establishing effective team behaviors, and employing fundamental team processes and tools. Given our expertise in improving cultures and climates of human service organizations, we introduce these core skills from the broader perspective of reinforcing highly effective cultural norms and practices that assure organizational effectiveness. This workshop is designed to provide fundamental meeting and team skill development, as well as materials that can be employed in your organizations to enhance work effectiveness. Materials and guidelines for subsequent activities are provided that allow participants to work on improvement in team functioning over time.","link":"http:\/\/arc.dev\/onsite-workshops\/"},{"title":"Organizational Social Context (OSC)","content":"Organizational Social Context (OSC) Organizational social context encompasses the human dimension of an organization including employees  expectations, how the organization  feels , and how employees interact with each other and with their clients.

It can be administered online or using paper scan forms. The OSC Measure is completed by front-line staff (rather than managers or leaders) to obtain the most representative view of the organization. It takes 20 minutes to complete. The OSC Measure provides normative data (percentiles) and graphs that present a    personality profile    of the organization, program or team being assessed. The OSC Measure can also be administered repeatedly to show change over time. Researchers have used the OSC Measure to assess a wide range of children   s services agencies across the U.S. and around the world. When combined with the research-proven ARC change strategy, the OSC measure becomes a touchstone for leaders and funders that connects improvements in organizations    cultures and climates to improvements in orgnaizational effectiveness.

Typically completed by children   s parents guardians, the SAC has exceptional psychometric qualities, and in 5 minutes accomplishes what other behavioral scales take 30 or more minutes to do. This time-saving feature makes the SAC much less frustrating for parents to complete, yet the SAC is reliable and valid. Tyson, E.H., & Glisson, C. (2005). A cross-ethnic validity study of the Shortform Assessment for Children (SAC). Research on Social Work Practice, 15(2), 9-109. Hemmelgarn, A.L., Glisson, C., & Sharp, S. (2003). The validity of the Shortform Assessment for Children. Research on Social Work Practice, 13, 510-530. Our SAC website makes the SAC easy to score and provides percentile scores for comparison to both normal and juvenile court youth populations. The website also archives data, allowing users to track children   s SAC scores over time and providing a graph of each child   s progress. The SAC is a useful tool that allows staff to monitor children   s behavioral outcomes and track changes in behaviors over time.   This feedback is important when engaging in organizational change efforts because the well-being of clients is ultimately the anticipated result of improving organizational climate and culture.   For researchers, the SAC is essential as a measure of children   s behavioral improvement. It has been used extensively in studies attempting to better understand the relationship between OSC, ARC and child outcomes.","link":"http:\/\/arc.dev\/shortform-assessment-for-children\/"},{"title":"Consulting Services for Leaders","content":"Consulting Services for Leaders Our lead ARC Specialist is available to work directly with a selected number of agency leaders.

Founded in 1989 by Dr. Charles Glisson, who is nationally recognized for his groundbreaking work on organizational social context, the CMHSRC from its beginnings conducted research to describe organizational culture and climate and their impact. This work led to a series of multi-year Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) of ARC, an organizational change strategy repeatedly shown to improve the cultures and climates of child welfare and mental health organizations. In addition, these RCTs showed that ARC reduces staff turnover, improves the sustainability of new innovations (such as EBPs), improves the quality of care, and, most important, improves youth outcomes. In the 20+ years of working in child welfare and community mental health organizations, we have learned firsthand about the many challenges and demands these organizations face. We also developed, and tested, a number of tools and strategies that these organizations   their leadership and staff   can together draw on to improve services, outcomes, and costs. We created the ARC Institute to disseminate the materials and knowledge that we have developed through the CMHSRC   s past quarter century of research. Much has been written about the wide gap divide between research and the community of practice. The ARC Institute addresses this gap.","link":"http:\/\/arc.dev\/about-us\/"},{"title":"Key Personnel","content":"Key Personnel Anthony Hemmelgarn, PhD ARC Specialist and Consultant 865-974-9143   ahemmelg@utk.edu Tony Hemmelgarn, an industrial and organizational psychologist, has worked at the Children   s Mental Health Services Research Center since its inception and is a primary Co-developer of ARC.

ARC Strategy Tony Hemmelgarn on the ARC strategy for improving mental health and child welfare organizations. Long-term improvement in human services goes beyond improving treatments, management systems and processes. Effective organizational social contexts (cultures and climates) must be put in place, or such improvements efforts will fail. In this video, key principles that underscore organizational effectiveness and how the ARC organizational effectiveness and how the ARC organizational change strategy embeds these principles are summarized.
